## General info
Texas voters must navigate an outdated web of county and state websites to find registration information and vote. I made an interactive and streamlined site for voters in Travis County, Texas to more easily find the information they're looking for. 

Check out the live site [here](https://epic-northcutt-e4f93e.netlify.com/)!

## Technologies
This is a static site built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. The map functionality comes from [Google's Civic API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/) and the [Voting Information Project's embeddable Voter Information Tool](https://www.votinginfoproject.org/about). Data is only populated to the API during election cycles.
